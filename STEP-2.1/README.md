the user can:
- add new todo:
  input a new content, click the 'Add' button to insert a todo
- toggle a todo:
  click on a todo item to toggle its status: completed
  - completed = true: ~~display text with a line through~~
  - completed = false: display normal text
- filter the todo list
  - all (default filter): get all the list
  - completed: get only completed todos
  - active: get only not completed todos

  when a filter is active, it will display in plain text, instead of a link
